# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-With-8-algorithm.
## What is parkinson disease?
This is the disease mostly occured in Old age when you start loosing control on your body and your body start shivering. You are not able to do any work properly.
For this we had taken the datset of the voice of those people who have parkinson and those who don't have parkinson. Voice have magnitude, amplitude, intensity and many more things that are enough to detect the disease.
Parkinson's Disease detection using 8 Algorithms and comparison of there performance.
I have used XGboosting technique in this project.
